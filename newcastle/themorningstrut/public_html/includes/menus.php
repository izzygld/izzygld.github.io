Arthritis by definition is inflammation of the joint, which can cause stiffness and pain. Arthritis can be frustrating and disabling if left untreated, and can affect your whole lifestyle.&nbsp; Finding out you have arthritis can be upsetting, and raises lots of questions, such as:&nbsp;how did I get arthritis?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You may have injured your joint years ago and, for some reason,&nbsp;it never healed properly.&nbsp; While it may have&nbsp;seemed fine at the time,&nbsp;hidden in there was undetected damage to the joint which ultimately lead to arthritis.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">blockblockimg_2491<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is possible that&nbsp;you overused the joint, by using it constantly, either at work or through physical activity, or by being overweight.&nbsp; Constant pressure can result from sitting long periods of time at work; standing for long periods also puts pressure on the joint.&nbsp;&nbsp; Baseball pitchers and dancers are at risk for arthritis because of their constant use of the joints.&nbsp; Being overweight puts pressure on the hips, knees, and ankles, and can also cause&nbsp;arthritis.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You may have an auto immune disorder that caused your arthritis.&nbsp; An auto immune disorder causes the immune system to attack the joint and damage it.&nbsp; White blood cells then form around the tissue and cartilage in the joint, attacking the health of the joint.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">blockblockimg_2492<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Age is certainly a factor for&nbsp;arthritis sufferers.&nbsp; Arthritis usually shows up around age 50 or older.&nbsp; However, adolescents can have arthritis, especially rheumatoid arthritis, but most adolescents affected by arthritis have&nbsp;a 75% remission by age 16.&nbsp; Women are more susceptible to some types of arthritis because of childbearing.&nbsp; As we get older, the&nbsp;body slows down, no longer providing the nutrients it needs to keep itself healthy.&nbsp; Women also undergo hormonal changes that can affect the natural balance of the body.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Genetics also play a role in&nbsp;arthritis.&nbsp; If your parents were arthritis sufferers, there&#39;s&nbsp;a good chance that you inherited it from them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are more than a hundred different types of arthritis known today.&nbsp; The questions of how, what, and why are always waiting&nbsp;to be answered. However,&nbsp;with there being so many types of arthritis, you may not always be able to find out the cause.&nbsp; Researchers are still looking for causes for some types of arthritis.&nbsp; The two most common types of arthritis today affect one in every five adults.&nbsp; These types are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While the causes listed above may answer the &quot;how?&quot; and &quot;why?&quot;, the &quot;what?&quot;&nbsp;is up to you.&nbsp; Only you can choose &quot;what&quot; you are going to do.&nbsp; blockblocklink_4134.&nbsp; Arthritis doesn&rsquo;t have to hinder your lifestyle.&nbsp; Talk with your doctor and&nbsp;find the best treatment plan for your symptoms to allow you to continue&nbsp;a good-quality lifestyle.<\/p>\r\n"},{"label":"Anxiety Self-Help","slug":"anxiety-self-help-2","content_id":"8607","title":"Anxiety Self-Help","site_author":"Christopher T.

The Internet is awash with positivity gurus, and one idea I hear a lot about, is the talk of &ldquo;how to manifest your ideal life.&rdquo; Even&nbsp;Oprah subscribes to the notion of &ldquo;Law of Attraction&rdquo;&nbsp;and has given&nbsp;a massive platform to the mega-fad, &ldquo;The Secret.&rdquo; But what is it? To boil it down to its essence (and I&rsquo;m aware I am simplifying), the Law of Attraction, which underpins a great deal of this kind of&nbsp;thinking, suggests that emotional outlook and thoughts are matched by the universe which then sends a corresponding physical reality.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">blockblockimg_2487<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to this idea, thoughts are things. There&rsquo;s no scientific evidence for the universe having this kind of mechanism, nor is there support for the idea that the human mind can, at will, bend physical reality in this way. These are topics for another time, but what I am interested in is how this notion treats mental health. If we create our reality, we are therefore responsible for everything in it. That means all the good that we have enjoyed is a result of our positive thinking. Similarly, all the negative that has blighted our lives arises from our negative mind-space. So what happens when someone is clinically depressed? How did that come about? Well, then you have to involve past lives and things like karma in order to account for a genetic predisposition and faulty brain chemistry. For me personally, that was likely activated during my teenage years &nbsp;when I suffered an extended and quite severe emotional trauma. Yet at the core, if I am to believe the Law of Attraction, I am to blame.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">blockblockimg_2488<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What&rsquo;s more, not only am I to blame for my past difficulties, but I&rsquo;m to blame for my current mental health issues because I could simply choose to feel good and move away from these mental health issues. Let that sit for a moment. Now let&rsquo;s extend that into a real life situation. Imagine someone is interested in self-help to change their life because they are not happy with their current state of affairs. In fact, they are feeling hopeless to the point that this is their last-ditch attempt. They turn to self-help books that emphasise concepts&nbsp;like the&nbsp;Law of Attraction as a way to attain better mental and physical well being. Because they are desperate, they begin religiously practicing the&nbsp;tenets, in particular, that they must keep a positive outlook&nbsp;and&nbsp;reign in their negative thoughts. This vulnerable person begins to feel slightly better about themselves, after all, they are now in control of their destiny. In fact, they feel empowered. They develop a sense of freedom and euphoria. Then something goes wrong. Quite by chance, they receive an unexpected bill through the mail. Or they have a bad day at work. But it isn&rsquo;t just chance, is it?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This Law of Attraction tells us that we create our reality. Therefore, the person concludes, he&rsquo;s to blame. He did this. He attracted that bad day, that bill, that negativity. Despite all his best efforts, he still attracted bad outcomes. Well, he&rsquo;ll have to try harder, so he begins to become obsessive about his thoughts, he can&rsquo;t sleep because he&rsquo;s constantly repeating positive mantras in his head, and because he can&rsquo;t sleep, he begins to feel physically unwell. His work begins to deteriorate. His depression deepens, his anxiety too. And it&rsquo;s all his fault. That&rsquo;s what the Law of Attraction tells him. It&rsquo;s his fault that he can&rsquo;t be positive and have a good life. What position does that leave him in? Well, I can tell you because that person was me. For a brief period during a particularly difficult time in my early 20s, I became so desperate to try to alleviate my suffering that I turned to anxiety self-help and self-improvement books that also included these&nbsp;kinds of ideas. You should also know that during my teenage years, I experienced a bout of psychosis where I also believed I had supernatural abilities &mdash; or more precisely, that spirits and demonic entities were whispering to me. I am not embarrassed about this. I was mentally unwell, but I highlight this because when I am compromised in this way,&nbsp;I and others like me are&nbsp;susceptible to this kind of thinking. So what does it feel like to have the Law of Attraction fail you?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">blockblockimg_2489<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To be frank, it felt like mental torture because it sets up a system of expectation, failure and then self-punishment. If you create your reality and your reality is consistently bad, frustrating, negative and altogether not what you want, it doesn&rsquo;t take you long to conclude that&nbsp;you&nbsp;are bad; that it is an inherent flaw within you that is poisoning everything. I simply couldn&rsquo;t be positive when my brain chemistry wouldn&rsquo;t allow it, and that is the fact of the matter. Now some may defend the Law of Attraction saying that it is to be taken with other so-called laws of the universe, or that it didn&rsquo;t work for me because I was mentally unwell. What I know is this: that the books, the DVDs, the online courses and retreats are all geared at people who are desperate to change their lives.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These people may not be mentally unwell going into programs like this, but they certainly are vulnerable and when they do not see the results that they want, they may become mentally unwell coming out of them. Anxiety self-help is possible and doesn&#39;t have to seem so intangible. The point here is that we do not need unproven and often pseudo-scientific &ldquo;laws&rdquo; to make positive changes in our lives: the tools like goal setting, planning and taking action are all within our reach. Not only that, but these so-called spiritual ideas&nbsp;can be incredibly damaging for those who are vulnerable, and in particular, people who have mental health issues. For their sake, and&nbsp;for my sake, we need clear thinking and properly funded medical mental health care so that people don&#39;t fall into&nbsp;a situation where they feel driven toward this kind of bad medicine. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n"},{"label":"Arthritis Diagnosis","slug":"arthritis-diagnosis","content_id":"3249","title":"Arthritis Diagnosis","site_author":"Anna J.

Some do it for someone they care about who actually needs it, and some for altruistic reasons. Others simply do it in order to receive free coupons and other gifts that blood centers offer for each donation.&nbsp;Less important than the reason is the fact that you actually did it, and you&#39;re among the few who did from all over the world.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But what are the reasons why people do not donate blood? Some say they never thought about it, because the opportunity never arose, but if they had to, they would. Other people choose not to&nbsp;give blood because they have a phobia of needles, or the sight of blood itself.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Firstly, it&#39;s worthwhile to learn a&nbsp;bit about different blood types. Those who are type&nbsp;O- can donate blood to every other blood type, so if you&#39;re among them, consider it as some sort of obligation to the world. The O+ type can be transfused to every other positive blood type and it is the most needed blood group, as it is found most frequently, in about 40% of all human beings.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">blockblockimg_1904&nbsp;There are a number of benefits of donating blood. It is a healthy habit for people who suffer from high blood pressure, frequent headaches and high cholesterol. Giving blood helps relieve some pressure in the body; it can even prevent you from developing a heart condition or having a heart attack, by regulating the levels or iron. This is particularly useful for menopausal women, whose iron levels rise because there is no more menstruation. Donating blood can give you a sense of fulfillment, knowing you&#39;ve&nbsp;done something good for other people, and by giving just a bit of your time, you&nbsp;might have actually saved someone&#39;s life. Think of all the people who have been in an accident, or who need surgery - they all need blood, and some need a lot. In addition to all this, there are always the free gifts. Sure, we all care about doing some good and being healthy, but who can resist the gift certificates and other prizes that you can receive after donating more than once? It is literally one of the easiest ways to get rewarded.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Donating blood definitely makes you a better person. With such&nbsp;little effort, you can change so much in other people&#39;s lives. So drop all &nbsp;the excuses and just try it once; you will definitely go back.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why Donate Blood? 8 Reasons Why You Should Give Blood<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Have you ever donated blood? If so, why did you do it? It may have been for a loved one or a friend. It may have been for the free coupons and gift certificates blood centers provide for donations. Maybe you&rsquo;re required to donate blood because you work in the medical field.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">blockblockimg_1905&nbsp;In actuality, less than 10% of the population has donated blood to the world&rsquo;s blood centers. Why? Most people say they&rsquo;ve never&nbsp;been asked. Some say they just need some reminding. Others are deathly afraid of blood or needles.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a blood donor myself, I have numerous reasons I donate. Initially,&nbsp;I started donating because I received extra credit for an archaeology class, believe it or not! However, after considering my health and blood type, I realized I have even more reason to do it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">If You&rsquo;re a Universal Donor, You Owe It To World To Donate Blood<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">O- is the universal donor because this blood type can be transfused to people of all blood types. A donor from the O+ blood group can donate to any positive blood group A+, B+ and AB+.&nbsp; O+ donors are needed more frequently than any other donor considering that close to 40% of the population is O+. I happen to be O+, hence the routine calls from the blood bank.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Donating Blood Is Healthy<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From a health standpoint, I can&rsquo;t think of a better way for people with high blood pressure, blockblocklink_3655, or high cholesterol to let go of some waste. I do it to help with my blood pressure and migraines, as unloading two pints of blood is the best way for me to relieve pressure in my brain and my body. Furthermore, donating blood changes the iron levels in your body, thus helping, and sometimes preventing, heart disease. This is especially important for women. Why? After women stop menstruating, they are no longer getting rid of iron. Actually, a woman&rsquo;s iron levels will increase after blockblocklink_3656. Giving blood is one of the safest and easiest ways to reduce levels of iron to healthy levels. Also, giving blood decreases the risk of heart attacks in men.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Donating Blood Is Personally Rewarding<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">blockblockimg_1906&nbsp;Knowing your donation will make a difference to someone else really makes you feel wonderful. Knowing that so few people actually do it, yet you take the time to show up for every one of your appointments, says something about your character.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Donating Blood: Incentives<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The incentives for giving blood are endless. Of course the health benefits are important, but we can&rsquo;t forget the free gift certificates, tickets, and IPads, we can receive just by taking 30 minutes out of our day. Yes, I said IPad! So far I&rsquo;ve received two subway foot longs, $10.00 to a barbecue restaurant, $20.00 to Darden restaurants, extra credit for a class just for donating (Heck yeah!), and I just started. I&rsquo;m also entering a video contest about donating blood to win an IPad. How cool is that!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Donating Blood Saves Lives<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Consider the individuals in the hospital needing a blood transfusion. A gunshot or accident victim. Any person needing an ample supply of blood while in surgery. These people need us, and what they ask for is very little. Just imagine what a few pints of blood can do and how many lives it can save.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Donating Blood Increases Your Own Awareness of Cholesterol Levels<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the added benefits of donating blood is having access to cholesterol levels. Results are readily available to you online so you can gage what you need to change in your diet, or you may just want to maintain healthy levels.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Donating Blood Is Free<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are very few free things in the world so why not take advantage of this one.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Donating Blood Makes You A Stronger Person<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">blockblockimg_1907&nbsp;It sounds clich&eacute;, but yes, giving blood will make you a stronger person. Knowing you have the power to affect a life changes your mind. It teaches you about weakness. Why? The first few minutes when the flow is started your mind starts to race with apprehension. Why? Have you seen the needle! I&rsquo;m not trying to terrify you, but even I, as someone who has received&nbsp;allergy shots her entire life, still get nervous. The way I get through it? I think about what a marine once&nbsp;told me when I wanted to give up when something was just too painful to bear: &ldquo;PAIN is WEAKNESS leaving the body.&rdquo; Man did that statement stick!

In recent years, diagnosis and treatment options have improved for celiac disease.&nbsp; Patients suffering from celiac disease or celiac sprue are sensitive to or allergic to the protein called gluten that is found in certain grains such as wheat, rye and barley. &nbsp; For these patients, a gluten-free diet is a necessity for recovery from damage to their intestines caused by an inflammatory reaction to gluten. There are certainly more pros than cons of a gluten-free diet for celiac disease sufferers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">blockblockimg_1924&nbsp;The most relevant pro of a gluten-free diet is that it allows time for the intestines to recover from inflammatory damage and begin to absorb necessary nutrients such as vitamins and minerals.&nbsp;This may help the celiac disease patient gain weight and minimize gastrointestinal symptoms.&nbsp; The case for gluten-free food for the celiac disease sufferer is obvious.&nbsp; As a result of changing to a gluten-free diet, celiac patients must be monitored for loss of vitamins found naturally in grains.&nbsp; These should be replaced with gluten-free alternative food or supplements. <!--more--> &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">blockblockimg_1925&nbsp;There are other conditions, including Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, blockblocklink_3677 and diabetes that are thought to improve once the patients eliminates glutens from the diet.
