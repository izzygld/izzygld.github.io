With this article, you can learn some basic tips that you can apply to your every day life to cope with and <a href=\"advice-for-preventing-and-treating-your-hemorrhoids\"  >prevent hemorrhoids<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/woman-consulting-her-doctor.jpg\" class=\"img_left \" alt=\"woman consulting her doctor\" style=\"float: left; padding: 8px; padding-left: 0;\" \/><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you find a growth but you&#39;re not certain if it is a hemorrhoid, consult with your doctor right away. Many have trouble discerning the difference between hemorrhoids and polyps, which may cause you to panic unnecessarily. Check with a doctor who can definitively diagnose what you are suffering from.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To make your hemorrhoids less painful, try making an enema. Add two garlic cloves to two cups of boiled water. Keep in in for about 30 minutes. Then, allow the water to cool off. Let it cool to room temperature, and use this enema once daily.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">No matter how badly a hemorrhoid is itching, make very sure you do not scratch it. If you do scratch, you&#39;ll end up breaking the skin, opening your body up to infection. You may, however, give the area a mild cleansing with a wet washcloth, used gently. The feeling of itchiness may be from the area not being&nbsp;clean, so dabbing a wet cloth on the area will cleanse it and relieve some itching.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the <a href=\"http:\/\/hemorrhoidreport.net\/hemorrhoid-information\/causes-of-hemorrhoids\/\"  >causes of hemorrhoids<\/a> is heavy lifting. Your body&#39;s strain is similar to the strain that you make when you&#39;re forcing a bowel movement. If you are frequently troubled by hemorrhoids, stay away from heavy lifting in general, even between flare ups.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/woman-sitting-on-a-donut-cushion.jpeg\" class=\"img_right \" alt=\"woman sitting on a donut cushion\" style=\"float: right; padding: 8px; padding-right: 0;\" \/><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Anal exercises may help you to avoid formation of internal and external hemorrhoids. Not utilizing the muscles of your anus can lead to insufficient blood flow, resulting in hemorrhoids. All it takes is five minutes a few times a day, you should flex your anus muscles and then hold them for five seconds at a time.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you&#39;re regularly in pain because of your hemorrhoids, you should look into purchasing a donut cushion. A donut cushion conforms to your body&#39;s natural curves, easing the pressure that is placed on painful areas, so you can rest comfortably even during a hemorrhoid flare-up. Simply sit on it, and you will be much more relaxed then sitting on other surfaces.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although it&#39;s not&nbsp;likely that you&#39;ll discuss this information in daily conversation, you could find it extremely useful for you or someone else who has had to suffer from&nbsp;hemorrhoids. This advice, together with help from your physician, can bring you quick relief from the condition. We hope you found these tips useful.<\/p>\r\n"}
