{"block1":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are like many people, you may struggle with allergies from time to time. For some people, allergies strike from time to time, while&nbsp;for others, they can be a constant struggle. If you are plagued by allergies, help does exist. You can get relief from your symptoms.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cross-contamination of foods helps spread allergies, so be sure to keep foods separate if a family member&nbsp;has food allergies. If you&#39;re allergic to peanuts but others in your family are not, it&#39;s wise to make a family decision to keep out&nbsp;that food altogether. This way, you won&#39;t have to worry about inadvertently coming into contact with the food source.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/portrait-of-a-woman-using-nasal-spray.jpg\" class=\"img_right \" alt=\"portrait of a woman using nasal spray\" style=\"float: right; padding: 8px; padding-right: 0;\" \/>&nbsp;Allergy shots may be ineffective in homes with pets, as the amount of dander present can be overwhelming. Although it&nbsp;may be easier said than done, if&nbsp;pets are relocated outdoors, and furnishings and rugs are thoroughly cleaned, allergy shots could then be effective.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vacuum as often as you can to relieve indoor allergens. Use vacuums that have a HEPA filter. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.explainthatstuff.com\/hepafilters.html\"  >HEPA filters<\/a> will trap the allergens that are making you miserable.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If one allergy product does produce the desired effect, it&#39;s not yet time to throw in the towel.&nbsp;There are more than just ingestible options for allergy sufferers. Other medical solutions you can try include prescription drugs, such as leukotriene blockers and nasal steroids, and basic OTC alternatives, such as antihistamine eye drops and nasal saline sprays.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Try to keep the windows in your home closed during the day because that&#39;s when pollen starts to thrive. If you want cool air, turn on your air conditioner. The air pollution and smog that builds up over dense urban areas can easily aggravate the allergies of city dwellers. If you live in the city and always find yourself congested then consider taking a trip outside of the city for a week. See how you feel, and when you return you may realize all of the smog is giving you allergies.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&#39;s&nbsp;possible to <a href=\"does-your-allergies-disrupt-your-life\"  >deal with your allergies and enjoy life<\/a>. Symptoms like watery eyes and sneezing don&#39;t need to rob you of the fun in your life.
