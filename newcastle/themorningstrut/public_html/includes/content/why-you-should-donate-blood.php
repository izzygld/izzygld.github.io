{"block1":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">People have different reasons for choosing to donate blood. Some do it for someone they care about who actually needs it, and some for altruistic reasons. Others simply do it in order to receive free coupons and other gifts that blood centers offer for each donation.&nbsp;Less important than the reason is the fact that you actually did it, and you&#39;re among the few who did from all over the world.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But what are the reasons why people do not donate blood? Some say they never thought about it, because the opportunity never arose, but if they had to, they would. Other people choose not to&nbsp;give blood because they have a phobia of needles, or the sight of blood itself.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Firstly, it&#39;s worthwhile to learn a&nbsp;bit about different blood types. Those who are type&nbsp;O- can donate blood to every other blood type, so if you&#39;re among them, consider it as some sort of obligation to the world. The O+ type can be transfused to every other positive blood type and it is the most needed blood group, as it is found most frequently, in about 40% of all human beings.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/portrait-of-a-nurse-with-patient-donating-blood.jpg\" class=\"img_right \" alt=\"portrait of a nurse with patient donating blood\" style=\"float: right; padding: 8px; padding-right: 0;\" \/>&nbsp;There are a number of benefits of donating blood. It is a healthy habit for people who suffer from high blood pressure, frequent headaches and high cholesterol. Giving blood helps relieve some pressure in the body; it can even prevent you from developing a heart condition or having a heart attack, by regulating the levels or iron. This is particularly useful for menopausal women, whose iron levels rise because there is no more menstruation. Donating blood can give you a sense of fulfillment, knowing you&#39;ve&nbsp;done something good for other people, and by giving just a bit of your time, you&nbsp;might have actually saved someone&#39;s life. Think of all the people who have been in an accident, or who need surgery - they all need blood, and some need a lot. In addition to all this, there are always the free gifts. Sure, we all care about doing some good and being healthy, but who can resist the gift certificates and other prizes that you can receive after donating more than once? It is literally one of the easiest ways to get rewarded.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Donating blood definitely makes you a better person. With such&nbsp;little effort, you can change so much in other people&#39;s lives. So drop all &nbsp;the excuses and just try it once; you will definitely go back.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why Donate Blood? 8 Reasons Why You Should Give Blood<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Have you ever donated blood? If so, why did you do it? It may have been for a loved one or a friend. It may have been for the free coupons and gift certificates blood centers provide for donations. Maybe you&rsquo;re required to donate blood because you work in the medical field.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/portrait-of-a-man-donating-blood.jpg\" class=\"img_left \" alt=\"portrait of a man donating blood\" style=\"float: left; padding: 8px; padding-left: 0;\" \/>&nbsp;In actuality, less than 10% of the population has donated blood to the world&rsquo;s blood centers. Why? Most people say they&rsquo;ve never&nbsp;been asked. Some say they just need some reminding. Others are deathly afraid of blood or needles.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a blood donor myself, I have numerous reasons I donate. Initially,&nbsp;I started donating because I received extra credit for an archaeology class, believe it or not! However, after considering my health and blood type, I realized I have even more reason to do it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">If You&rsquo;re a Universal Donor, You Owe It To World To Donate Blood<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">O- is the universal donor because this blood type can be transfused to people of all blood types. A donor from the O+ blood group can donate to any positive blood group A+, B+ and AB+.&nbsp; O+ donors are needed more frequently than any other donor considering that close to 40% of the population is O+. I happen to be O+, hence the routine calls from the blood bank.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Donating Blood Is Healthy<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From a health standpoint, I can&rsquo;t think of a better way for people with high blood pressure, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/migraine-headache\/basics\/definition\/con-20026358\"  >migraines<\/a>, or high cholesterol to let go of some waste. I do it to help with my blood pressure and migraines, as unloading two pints of blood is the best way for me to relieve pressure in my brain and my body. Furthermore, donating blood changes the iron levels in your body, thus helping, and sometimes preventing, heart disease. This is especially important for women. Why? After women stop menstruating, they are no longer getting rid of iron. Actually, a woman&rsquo;s iron levels will increase after <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webmd.com\/menopause\/\"  >menopause<\/a>. Giving blood is one of the safest and easiest ways to reduce levels of iron to healthy levels. Also, giving blood decreases the risk of heart attacks in men.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Donating Blood Is Personally Rewarding<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/woman-doing-a-heart-sign.jpg\" class=\"img_right \" alt=\"woman doing a heart sign\" style=\"float: right; padding: 8px; padding-right: 0;\" \/>&nbsp;Knowing your donation will make a difference to someone else really makes you feel wonderful. Knowing that so few people actually do it, yet you take the time to show up for every one of your appointments, says something about your character.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Donating Blood: Incentives<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The incentives for giving blood are endless. Of course the health benefits are important, but we can&rsquo;t forget the free gift certificates, tickets, and IPads, we can receive just by taking 30 minutes out of our day. Yes, I said IPad! So far I&rsquo;ve received two subway foot longs, $10.00 to a barbecue restaurant, $20.00 to Darden restaurants, extra credit for a class just for donating (Heck yeah!), and I just started. I&rsquo;m also entering a video contest about donating blood to win an IPad. How cool is that!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Donating Blood Saves Lives<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Consider the individuals in the hospital needing a blood transfusion. A gunshot or accident victim. Any person needing an ample supply of blood while in surgery. These people need us, and what they ask for is very little. Just imagine what a few pints of blood can do and how many lives it can save.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Donating Blood Increases Your Own Awareness of Cholesterol Levels<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the added benefits of donating blood is having access to cholesterol levels. Results are readily available to you online so you can gage what you need to change in your diet, or you may just want to maintain healthy levels.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Donating Blood Is Free<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are very few free things in the world so why not take advantage of this one.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Donating Blood Makes You A Stronger Person<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/portrait-of-blood-donation-injecion.jpg\" class=\"img_left \" alt=\"portrait of blood donation injecion\" style=\"float: left; padding: 8px; padding-left: 0;\" \/>&nbsp;It sounds clich&eacute;, but yes, giving blood will make you a stronger person. Knowing you have the power to affect a life changes your mind. It teaches you about weakness. Why? The first few minutes when the flow is started your mind starts to race with apprehension. Why? Have you seen the needle! I&rsquo;m not trying to terrify you, but even I, as someone who has received&nbsp;allergy shots her entire life, still get nervous. The way I get through it? I think about what a marine once&nbsp;told me when I wanted to give up when something was just too painful to bear: &ldquo;PAIN is WEAKNESS leaving the body.&rdquo; Man did that statement stick! No pun intended<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why Don&rsquo;t You Donate Blood?<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Less than 10% of the population actually donates blood. Why? Most individuals claim they&rsquo;re afraid to get <a href=\"http:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/17131.php\"  >AIDS<\/a>; they&rsquo;re afraid of needles; they&rsquo;re too busy; they don&rsquo;t have enough blood to spare; their blood is rare; they&rsquo;re too old to donate blood. All excuses, and most without merit.<\/p>\r\n"}
