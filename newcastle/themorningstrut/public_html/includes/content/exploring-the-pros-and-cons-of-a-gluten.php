{"block1":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nutritional evaluation has become an important component of the treatment of many diseases that affect the gastrointestinal system. In recent years, diagnosis and treatment options have improved for celiac disease.&nbsp; Patients suffering from celiac disease or celiac sprue are sensitive to or allergic to the protein called gluten that is found in certain grains such as wheat, rye and barley. &nbsp; For these patients, a gluten-free diet is a necessity for recovery from damage to their intestines caused by an inflammatory reaction to gluten. There are certainly more pros than cons of a gluten-free diet for celiac disease sufferers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/portrait-of-hands-with-arthritis.jpg\" class=\"img_right \" alt=\"portrait of hands with arthritis\" style=\"float: right; padding: 8px; padding-right: 0;\" \/>&nbsp;The most relevant pro of a gluten-free diet is that it allows time for the intestines to recover from inflammatory damage and begin to absorb necessary nutrients such as vitamins and minerals.&nbsp;This may help the celiac disease patient gain weight and minimize gastrointestinal symptoms.&nbsp; The case for gluten-free food for the celiac disease sufferer is obvious.&nbsp; As a result of changing to a gluten-free diet, celiac patients must be monitored for loss of vitamins found naturally in grains.&nbsp; These should be replaced with gluten-free alternative food or supplements. <!--more--> &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/basket-full-of-fruits-and-vegetables.jpg\" class=\"img_left \" alt=\"basket full of fruits and vegetables\" style=\"float: left; padding: 8px; padding-left: 0;\" \/>&nbsp;There are other conditions, including Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webmd.com\/arthritis\/\"  >arthritis<\/a> and diabetes that are thought to improve once the patients eliminates glutens from the diet. However, supportive evidence has not been established for a gluten-free diet as lifestyle therapy.&nbsp;With the increased availability of gluten-free products, including processed and pre-packaged foods, comes the cons of using a gluten-free diet as a fad approach for weight loss rather than eating healthier options.&nbsp; Substantial use of gluten-free packaged products is not an appropriate substitute for the benefits of eating a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, high-fiber starches, lean meats and healthy fats.&nbsp; A varied diet rich in heart-healthy natural foods is a better way than gluten-free approaches to weight loss. &nbsp; In contrast, the cons of a gluten-free diet focus on poor dietary choices that lead to inadequate or excessive calorie consumption and poor food varieties in the diet.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Without proper education and nutritional guidance, the cons of a gluten-free diet include avoidance of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nlm.nih.gov\/medlineplus\/ency\/article\/002469.htm\"  >carbohydrates<\/a>. There is also a concern of not eating sufficient fiber while ingesting gluten-free processed food that may be filled with fat and sugar.&nbsp; One significant con of a following a gluten-free diet is unwittingly eating a nutrient-poor diet because of worries and fears of ingesting foods that are not tolerated. &nbsp; There are several pitfalls, pros and cons for adhering to a gluten-free diet.&nbsp; If a patient has been diagnosed with celiac disease, obtaining clear and thorough advice on dietary substitutions from a trained nutritional counselor is essential.&nbsp; For anyone concerned with weight loss, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nlm.nih.gov\/medlineplus\/parkinsonsdisease.html\"  >Parkinson\u0092s disease<\/a>, arthritis, and diabetes, do seek thoughtful advice from a health professional.<\/p>\r\n"}
