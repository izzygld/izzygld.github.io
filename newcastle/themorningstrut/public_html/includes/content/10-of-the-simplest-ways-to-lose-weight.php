{"block1":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is the hot topic of the century, and if we continue eating the way we do and maintaining a sedentary lifestyle, we&#39;ll be talking about it for a long time to come. While there are those who are genetically predisposed to have a little more weight than average, obesity is usually attributed to eating habits and lifestyle. Fortunately,&nbsp;there are solutions to the problem.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">#10&nbsp;Watch Those Calories<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you seriously intend to lose weight,&nbsp;pay attention to those calories and zap the unwanted ones quickly. Your best solution here is the age old, tried and proven method; exercise. Try not to make this a chore but actually do something that you like. For example you may opt to play your favorite sport, try some fancy dance moves or hit the gym if that&#39;s something you can do consistently. Run more than you walk or try skipping. There&#39;s always talk about exercise, but the key to weight loss is really consistency. So ensure that whatever routine you choose, you&#39;ll keep at it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/portrait-of-a-happy-woman-with-different-food.jpg\" class=\"img_left \" alt=\"portrait of a happy woman with different food\" style=\"float: left; padding: 8px; padding-left: 0;\" \/> w<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">#9&nbsp;Eat the Right Food<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nothing contributes to weight gain like eating the wrong kinds of food.
