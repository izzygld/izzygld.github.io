These can sometimes&nbsp;make you tired and impair your reflexes. Even if the packaging does not contain a warning, when you take the first couple of doses, do so during a time that you can stay home and see how it makes you feel.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/portrait-of-a-man-consulting-his-doctor.jpg\" class=\"img_left \" alt=\"portrait of a man consulting his doctor\" style=\"float: left; padding: 8px; padding-left: 0;\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don&#39;t leave it up to your nurse or doctor to read the notation on your chart that says you are allergic to latex. Always inform medical professionals. Only the slightest contact with latex, in gloves or on stethoscopes, can generate an allergic reaction.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you own a pet and you suffer from allergies, you might be wondering whether your pet is to blame for your symptoms. Instead of assuming that your pet is the cause, visit an allergist to get tested. You will not necessarily need to find a new home for your pet, though you might need to alter your arrangements somewhat.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Keep your windows closed during the daytime hours when the pollen is most prevalent. Instead of opening the window, it is best to switch on your air conditioner, as it can cool your home without bringing in pollen and other allergens.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you want to go for a vacation out of town, plan accordingly. If you suffer from allergies, or you will be traveling with someone who suffers from allergies, make sure to research pollen counts, weather conditions, available foods, and anything&nbsp;that could potentially trigger allergies.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/portrait-of-a-woman-using-vacuum.jpg\" class=\"img_right \" alt=\"portrait of a woman using vacuum\" style=\"float: right; padding: 8px; padding-right: 0;\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">During allergy season, style your hair without using sprays, gels or creams, as these&nbsp;products are known to be pollen magnets and could turn your tresses into an allergen free-for-all. When you spend time outside, understand that you will bring airborne allergens such as pollen home with you.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If outdoor allergens are giving you grief, it is best to travel in your car with all windows rolled up, and always keep it clean. If you use an air conditioner with the vents closed it will keep out pollen as well as other allergens. Regular vacuuming will keep your upholstery and interior free from allergens.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Taking the above advice should significantly reduce your allergy symptoms. While allergies are common, there are many ways to deal with them. Remember the guidelines in this articl, to help you live symptom-free.<\/p>\r\n"}
