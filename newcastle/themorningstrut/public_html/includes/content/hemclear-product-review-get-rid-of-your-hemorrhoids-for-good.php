{"block1":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is no ideal way to broach the subject of hemorrhoids, but it is a problem for many people and sometimes you just have to pass along helpful information, even if it&#39;s about something&nbsp;most people don&rsquo;t discuss.&nbsp; Hemorrhoids are swollen veins around the anal area that become enlarged and generally protrude from the anus.&nbsp; They are uncomfortable when you sit or&nbsp;stand, as well as painful. In some cases they can become so severe, that they actually bleed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Different types of hemorrhoids<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hemorrhoids burn and itch and cause a lot of discomfort during bowel movements, and sometimes there will be blood in the stool or in the toilet bowl.&nbsp; Some people have what is known as an internal hemorrhoid.&nbsp; This is a hemorrhoid that does not protrude from the anus, but it can still be uncomfortable during a bowel movement.&nbsp; These are the ones that will normally bleed, and that may be the only symptom you have of the internal hemorrhoid. Hemorrhoids are caused by a variety of factors, one of which&nbsp;is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webmd.com\/digestive-disorders\/digestive-diseases-constipation\"  >constipation<\/a>.&nbsp; When you are constipated, you tend to strain to have a bowel movement, and the increased pressure causes the veins to protrude from the anus, resulting in hemorrhoids.&nbsp; Some people get hemorrhoids when they have diarrhea; again,&nbsp;the added strain during bowel movements causes the veins to protrude from the anal area.&nbsp; Women who are pregnant will sometimes suffer from hemorrhoids.&nbsp; The additional weight that they carry with the baby can cause undue stress on the veins around the anus, eventually leading to hemorrhoids.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Getting rid of hemorrhoids<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/portrait-of-a-woman-holding-a-bottle-of-supplement.jpg\" class=\"img_left \" alt=\"portrait of a woman holding a bottle of supplement\" style=\"float: left; padding: 8px; padding-left: 0;\" \/>&nbsp;No matter what caused your&nbsp;hemorrhoids, the main thing on your mind is how to get rid of them, and fast.&nbsp; This is why I want to tell you about a breakthrough product called <a href=\"http:\/\/hemclear.com\/\"  >HemClear<\/a>.&nbsp; It works to relieve your hemorrhoids and it works quickly.&nbsp; Unlike other products that can only relieve the symptoms of hemorrhoids, HemClear works to get rid of the entire hemorrhoid by working from the inside of your body&nbsp;out.&nbsp; The hemorrhoids will go away and the symptoms along with them.
