{"block1":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If are suffering from joint pain or inflammation, see your doctor.&nbsp; Joint pain and inflammation, as well as stiffness and loss of range of motion are all <a href=\"http:\/\/jointreport.net\/joint-information\/the-main-symptoms-of-arthritis\/\"  >symptoms of arthritis<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Early detection of arthritis increases your chance of fighting it.&nbsp; It may be very helpful to the doctor if you keep notes about your symptoms, as this will aid him or her in diagnosing your condition.&nbsp; You can expect to receive a full medical examination during your visit.&nbsp; The doctor will discuss your symptoms and may require you to have other tests as well.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some of the tests the doctor might require are listed below.&nbsp; It may be necessary for you to have more than one of these tests.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/doctor-working-with-patients-hand-and-elbow.jpg\" class=\"img_right \" alt=\"doctor working with patients hand and elbow\" style=\"float: right; padding: 8px; padding-right: 0;\" \/><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Range of Motion<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because you are experiencing joint pain, the doctor may require certain <a href=\"http:\/\/study.com\/academy\/lesson\/what-is-range-of-motion-rom-definition-types-testing-exercises.html\"  >range of motion<\/a> tests.&nbsp; These exercises will help in diagnosing your condition.&nbsp; The difference in range of motion, as well as the way your movement affects you, will help provide a proper diagnosis.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Blood Test<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The doctor may order a blood test to check a number of things.&nbsp; The blood will be checked for protein.&nbsp; A high protein count is a sign of inflammation.&nbsp; The white blood cell level will be checked to see if there are signs of infection or an auto immune disorder.&nbsp; Uric acid levels will be checked, as elevated uric acid levels are a sign of gout.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/x-ray-features-of-early-rheumatoid-arthritis.jpg\" class=\"img_left \" alt=\"X-ray Features of Early Rheumatoid Arthritis\" style=\"float: left; padding: 8px; padding-left: 0;\" \/><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">X-rays<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">X-rays are taken because they can reveal any damage to the bones making up the joint.&nbsp; If there is lipping, spurs, or any type of overgrowth of deformities of the bone, this test will show it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">MRI<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a more in-depth scanning of the joint.&nbsp; This imaging is better than an x-ray.&nbsp; X-rays show the bones, while an MRI shows the bones, the tissue, and the cartilage of the joint.&nbsp; This test can be very informative toward a proper diagnosis.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Arthrocentesis<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Arthrocentesis is a method used to remove a sample of synovial fluid from the joint using a long needle.&nbsp; The needle is inserted into the cavity of the joint and fluid is withdrawn.&nbsp; The synovial fluid is examined for white blood cells which, if found, can indicate&nbsp;severe inflammation and infection.&nbsp; An excess of synovial fluid indicates a bacterial infection.&nbsp; Examining the synovial fluid can help your diagnosis.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These are a few of the more common tests doctors use in diagnosing types of arthritis.&nbsp; The results of these tests will enable your doctor to prepare a proper treatment plan.&nbsp; Treatment plans vary with each individual case, the doctor will discuss your options and together you can find the best treatment plan for your specific condition.&nbsp; In some cases, your doctor may feel more comfortable referring you to a specialist.&nbsp; A rheumatologist specializes in certain arthritis conditions and may be better suited to properly diagnose your condition.&nbsp; The rheumatologist may be more able to treat your symptoms.<\/p>\r\n"}
