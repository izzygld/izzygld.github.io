{"block1":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Mediterranean Sea area is well-known for its rich foods. Many are prepared with fresh fruits and vegetables. Instead of fatty butter or margarine, organic extra-virgin olive oil is used to prepare meals. Those who love dishes prepared with these ingredients, and who also love a glass of Merlot will love Mediterranean meals.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vegetables and Fruits<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/fruits-and-vegetables.jpg\" class=\"img_right \" alt=\"fruits and vegetables\" style=\"float: right; padding: 8px; padding-right: 0;\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fruits and vegetables are combined with natural yogurts to make wholesome meals. Instead of red meat, Mediterranean dishes are prepared with fresh fish, such as striper and tilapia. Meals are also made with lean chicken and rooster. At least two servings of striper are eaten per week in the area. For lunch, you may have lentil broth. A modest amount of nuts, an excellent health choice, are consumed every day. The most nutritious nuts are walnuts, peanuts and hazelnuts.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Carbohydrates<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/mediterranean-salad.jpg\" class=\"img_right \" alt=\"mediterranean salad\" style=\"float: right; padding: 8px; padding-right: 0;\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Mediterranean diet places emphasis on the reduction of body fat. Salads are made with feta cheese instead of with cheddar cheese. Real whole milk is preferred. Sugar is permitted in the Mediterranean diet. More emphasis is placed on whole grains, like breads served with the meal. Brown rice is also popular. Steer clear of foods that have high fat content levels, like butter. Also, keep your carbohydrate levels low. Canola and organic olive oils provide a source of <a href=\"http:\/\/omega3report.org\/omega-3-information\/understanding-the-significance-of-omega-3-and-pcbs-in-fish-oil-supplements\/\"  >omega-3 acids<\/a>, which are good choices for a healthy heart, and can also help you avoid plaque build-up in your arteries.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to the Mayo Clinic,&nbsp;Merlot, which is a&nbsp;red wine,&nbsp;can benefit the cardiovascular system when drunk in moderation. This is because Merlot contains antioxidants that can combat infection. Men and women should limit their wine intake to between five and 10 ounces a day.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Processed foods are avoided. Deep-fried&nbsp;foods may be tasty, but they have higher levels of saturated fat and should be avoided.
