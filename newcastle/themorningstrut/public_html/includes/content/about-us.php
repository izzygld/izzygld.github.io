Well, let&#39;s start at the beginning&hellip;.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s give you a little bit of background about me. I&rsquo;m the youngest of three siblings and grew up in Los Angeles, California. I was pretty healthy as a child until high school. Then like most teenage girls, I started dieting. At first it was innocent enough&hellip; I just wanted to lose 2-3 pounds for the Spring Formal, then another 3 for the end-of-year dance, then another 6 for the prom. Pretty soon, I was desperate to lose more and more weight but I still craved all the yummy junk and fast food. Before I knew it I was on a slippery slope that led to me to a dark world that many young women find themselves&hellip;.the world of anorexia and bulimia. I would starve myself until I would literally pass out and then I would go out with my friends and gorge myself on burgers and fries to go home and throw it all up. I was on a vicious cycle of no return. Luckily for me, my parents got involved. My mom took me to a doctor and a nutritionist and we all went to family therapy sessions together. They forced me to look at myself, deep-down and not only face my own demons but to embark on my own journey of self discovery and healthy eating.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the love, support and attention I got from my family, friends and professionals saved me.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>I became inspired to help others. It is that simple. My goal in life. I want to help others on their journey to a better, healthier and more balanced life.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope you will join me.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ana Mendoza<br \/>\r\nHolistic Nutrition Lifestyle Coach<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n"}
