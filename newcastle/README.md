# Introduction
Wey, hello and welcome to NewcastleGateshead
United by seven bridges across a spectacular riverscape, Newcastle (a city on the north bank of the River Tyne) and Gateshead (a town on the south bank) form a single, diverse and extremely vibrant visitor destination.

With so many different areas each offering new sights, sounds and experiences, youâ€™ll be amazed at how much is on offer whatever your tastes. World-class culture, vibrant nightlife, award-winning dining, inspiring heritage, fantastic shopping and acclaimed architecture are linked here, as nowhere else, by the famous Geordie spirit
And for this very reason I decided to turn it into an app
covering some magnificent places in Geordie-land.
