Exposing these to the tissue can cause painful stinging and greater&nbsp;itching and swelling sensations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to relieving the discomfort of hemorrhoids, combined hot-and-cold therapy is one of your best bets. Alternating ice and heat will shrink the hemorrhoid and help it to heal. Apply ice to the area affected for about ten minutes every day, and follow it with moist heat for twenty minutes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/woman-holding-a-glass-of-water-and-supplement-pills.jpg\" class=\"img_left \" alt=\"woman holding a glass of water and supplement pills\" style=\"float: left; padding: 8px; padding-left: 0;\" \/>&nbsp;You want to nourish your body to the best of your ability, so go ahead and <a href=\"http:\/\/hemclear.com\/\"  >take supplements<\/a> if you aren&#39;t managing to get the right balance of nutrients in your diet.

These can be effective against flareups. Anyone can safely use this product, which is much like a sanitary pad that women use when they have their menstrual period.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To avoid much of the pain involved with hemorrhoids, stay away from gassy foods. Passing gas can cause painful inflammations. Gas-causing food will only cause you burning discomfort, so steer clear of them.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aloe Vera juice is good to drink to help make the stools loose and easier to pass. Combining <a href=\"http:\/\/www.livestrong.com\/article\/544696-aloe-hemorrhoids\/\"  >Aloe Vera<\/a> with apple juice often masks the bitter flavor. Before drinking the juice, however, you should carefully read the directions and drink only the recommended dosage. Drinking more than the recommended amount can cause an upset stomach.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The best way to avoid hemorrhoids is to keep your stools soft which will reduce straining and pressure.
