{"block1":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A few months ago&nbsp;I wrote about the upside to realistic positive thinking, and how it can be useful as a depression and anxiety self-help tool.&nbsp;But what happens when we take that positivity to unrealistic lengths, and it gets clouded with so-called spiritual ideas? The Internet is awash with positivity gurus, and one idea I hear a lot about, is the talk of &ldquo;how to manifest your ideal life.&rdquo; Even&nbsp;Oprah subscribes to the notion of &ldquo;Law of Attraction&rdquo;&nbsp;and has given&nbsp;a massive platform to the mega-fad, &ldquo;The Secret.&rdquo; But what is it? To boil it down to its essence (and I&rsquo;m aware I am simplifying), the Law of Attraction, which underpins a great deal of this kind of&nbsp;thinking, suggests that emotional outlook and thoughts are matched by the universe which then sends a corresponding physical reality.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/photo-of-a-woman-suffering-depression.jpg\" class=\"img_right \" alt=\"photo of a woman suffering depression\" style=\"float: right; padding: 8px; padding-right: 0;\" \/><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to this idea, thoughts are things. There&rsquo;s no scientific evidence for the universe having this kind of mechanism, nor is there support for the idea that the human mind can, at will, bend physical reality in this way. These are topics for another time, but what I am interested in is how this notion treats mental health. If we create our reality, we are therefore responsible for everything in it. That means all the good that we have enjoyed is a result of our positive thinking. Similarly, all the negative that has blighted our lives arises from our negative mind-space. So what happens when someone is clinically depressed? How did that come about? Well, then you have to involve past lives and things like karma in order to account for a genetic predisposition and faulty brain chemistry. For me personally, that was likely activated during my teenage years &nbsp;when I suffered an extended and quite severe emotional trauma. Yet at the core, if I am to believe the Law of Attraction, I am to blame.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/photo-of-a-man-with-mental-health-issues.jpg\" class=\"img_left \" alt=\"photo of a man with mental health issues\" style=\"float: left; padding: 8px; padding-left: 0;\" \/><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What&rsquo;s more, not only am I to blame for my past difficulties, but I&rsquo;m to blame for my current mental health issues because I could simply choose to feel good and move away from these mental health issues. Let that sit for a moment. Now let&rsquo;s extend that into a real life situation. Imagine someone is interested in self-help to change their life because they are not happy with their current state of affairs. In fact, they are feeling hopeless to the point that this is their last-ditch attempt. They turn to self-help books that emphasise concepts&nbsp;like the&nbsp;Law of Attraction as a way to attain better mental and physical well being. Because they are desperate, they begin religiously practicing the&nbsp;tenets, in particular, that they must keep a positive outlook&nbsp;and&nbsp;reign in their negative thoughts. This vulnerable person begins to feel slightly better about themselves, after all, they are now in control of their destiny. In fact, they feel empowered. They develop a sense of freedom and euphoria. Then something goes wrong. Quite by chance, they receive an unexpected bill through the mail. Or they have a bad day at work. But it isn&rsquo;t just chance, is it?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This Law of Attraction tells us that we create our reality. Therefore, the person concludes, he&rsquo;s to blame. He did this. He attracted that bad day, that bill, that negativity. Despite all his best efforts, he still attracted bad outcomes. Well, he&rsquo;ll have to try harder, so he begins to become obsessive about his thoughts, he can&rsquo;t sleep because he&rsquo;s constantly repeating positive mantras in his head, and because he can&rsquo;t sleep, he begins to feel physically unwell. His work begins to deteriorate. His depression deepens, his anxiety too. And it&rsquo;s all his fault. That&rsquo;s what the Law of Attraction tells him. It&rsquo;s his fault that he can&rsquo;t be positive and have a good life. What position does that leave him in? Well, I can tell you because that person was me. For a brief period during a particularly difficult time in my early 20s, I became so desperate to try to alleviate my suffering that I turned to anxiety self-help and self-improvement books that also included these&nbsp;kinds of ideas. You should also know that during my teenage years, I experienced a bout of psychosis where I also believed I had supernatural abilities &mdash; or more precisely, that spirits and demonic entities were whispering to me. I am not embarrassed about this. I was mentally unwell, but I highlight this because when I am compromised in this way,&nbsp;I and others like me are&nbsp;susceptible to this kind of thinking. So what does it feel like to have the Law of Attraction fail you?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/photo-of-a-mature-woman-frustrated.jpg\" class=\"img_right \" alt=\"photo of a mature woman frustrated\" style=\"float: right; padding: 8px; padding-right: 0;\" \/><\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To be frank, it felt like mental torture because it sets up a system of expectation, failure and then self-punishment. If you create your reality and your reality is consistently bad, frustrating, negative and altogether not what you want, it doesn&rsquo;t take you long to conclude that&nbsp;you&nbsp;are bad; that it is an inherent flaw within you that is poisoning everything. I simply couldn&rsquo;t be positive when my brain chemistry wouldn&rsquo;t allow it, and that is the fact of the matter. Now some may defend the Law of Attraction saying that it is to be taken with other so-called laws of the universe, or that it didn&rsquo;t work for me because I was mentally unwell. What I know is this: that the books, the DVDs, the online courses and retreats are all geared at people who are desperate to change their lives.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These people may not be mentally unwell going into programs like this, but they certainly are vulnerable and when they do not see the results that they want, they may become mentally unwell coming out of them. Anxiety self-help is possible and doesn&#39;t have to seem so intangible. The point here is that we do not need unproven and often pseudo-scientific &ldquo;laws&rdquo; to make positive changes in our lives: the tools like goal setting, planning and taking action are all within our reach. Not only that, but these so-called spiritual ideas&nbsp;can be incredibly damaging for those who are vulnerable, and in particular, people who have mental health issues. For their sake, and&nbsp;for my sake, we need clear thinking and properly funded medical mental health care so that people don&#39;t fall into&nbsp;a situation where they feel driven toward this kind of bad medicine. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n"}
