{"block1":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For over 40 years, smoking has been on the receiving end of much bad press, as well as&nbsp;advice coming from parents, teachers, clergy, doctors and the government.&nbsp;In fact, in many places there is a total ban on cigarette advertising so that young smokers don&#39;t&nbsp;even know one of the once-popular taglines, &ldquo;I&#39;ll&nbsp;walk a mile for a...&rdquo;&nbsp;And yet, 22% of the global population are smokers. That&rsquo;s only the median, though. The range can go from as low as 12%, in some countries&nbsp;to as high as 40% of the population in others. Ironically, smokers are just as surprised at this high incidence of smoking.&nbsp; After all, they are restricted by government laws to few areas where they can smoke.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, why do smokers continue to smoke?&nbsp;Young smokers will confirm that they smoke either because of &ldquo;group&rdquo; conformity (&ldquo;my friends smoke and drink, etc.&rdquo;), or out of defiance against authority (&ldquo;my parents and teachers don&rsquo;t understand me&rdquo;), or just like adults, to release emotional and psychological stress (&ldquo;I just need a little quiet time&rdquo;).&nbsp;Because, once they start, people find it so difficult to stop themselves from smoking, there is now a global movement to completely prohibit the manufacture of cigarettes&hellip;despite the fact that making hand-rolled cigarettes is just as easy. So, how does one solve a smoking habit that is as risky as drinking, as addictive as gambling, and as satisfying as sex? Is the answer prohibition? Governmental control? Medical advisories? &nbsp;Take note that&nbsp;even smoking substitution devices do not reduce the need for a cigarette. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Health Risks of Smoking<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"\/images\/portrait-of-a-doctor-examining-male-patient.jpg\" class=\"img_right \" alt=\"portrait of a doctor examining male patient\" style=\"float: right; padding: 8px; padding-right: 0;\" \/>&nbsp;&ldquo;Cigarettes contain more than 4,000 chemical compounds and&hellip;400 toxic compounds.&rdquo;&nbsp;Such numbers will strike fear in anyone with a healthy respect for his body and a love for his life. On the other hand, perhaps these numbers&nbsp;don&#39;t&nbsp;mean anything. Instead, let&#39;s look at all the devastating health issues smoking causes. Here are some more statistics: Compared with non-smokers, smoking is estimated to increase the risk of:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">men developing lung cancer by 23 times,<\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">women developing lung cancer by 13 times,<\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">dying from chronic obstructive lung diseases by 12 to 13 times.<\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">coronary heart disease by 2 to 4 times,<\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">stroke by 2 to 4 times.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Source:&nbsp; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Office on Smoking and Health E-mail: tobaccoinfo@cdc.gov Phone: 1-800-CDC-INFO Let us briefly describe the aforementioned diseases:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lung cancer<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">80% of lung cancer is caused by smoking.&nbsp; It is characterized by chronic cough, persistent chest pains, and coughing up of blood.&nbsp; The presence of a tumor differentiates it from chronic obstructive lung diseases.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">COPD (Chronic obstructive lung diseases)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Smoking is the main cause of COPD.&nbsp; There are 2 types of lung diseases:&nbsp; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nlm.nih.gov\/medlineplus\/chronicbronchitis.html\"  >chronic bronchitis<\/a>, which is characterized by presence of mucus when coughing and which lasts for at least 3 months;&nbsp;&nbsp;and emphysema, in which the air sacs of the lungs are damaged, something that causes breathlessness.
