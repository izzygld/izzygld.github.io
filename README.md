===============================

Files:
======
* Index contains the HTML code.
* CSS folder contains CSS format file
images folder contains all the artwork for this game.
* js folder contains:
   * app file : framework by Udacity and updated by me
    * engine: given by Udacity
    * resources: given by Udacity


Loading Game:
=============
To load the game go to the folder named "frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game." Open the folder and right click the index folder and choose to open with the Chrome web browser. Chrome will open and automatically start the game. The player starts at the bottom.

Game Controls:
=========
* Use the arrow keys ↑ → ↓ ←, to move the player .
* On game over, restart the game by refreshing the page.

Playing the Game:
=========

Move your player around the game board by using the arrow keys:

* 'up arrow' moves your player up one square.
* 'down arrow' moves your player down one square.
* 'right arrow' moves your player right one square.
* 'left arrow' moves your player left one square.

The player cannot 'wrap around' - for instance, you cannot move left from the far left squares to get to the far right edge.

Bug characters are the enemy. They are constantly in motion from left to right, and as they disappear off the right edge of the screen they will reappear on the left edge. Colliding with a bug will reduce your lives and move your player back to the beginning square at the bottom of the game area.

Object of Game:
===============
You must try to cross the road without getting hit by the bugs. If you get hit by a bug, you are returning to the starting postion and losing a life . If you make it to the water, you are return to the starting position again with a added point to your score.


Credits and acknowledgements:
=============================

Thanks for trying it!.
